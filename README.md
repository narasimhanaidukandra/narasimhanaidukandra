Developed a machine learning model to accurately detect and classify brain tumors from MRI scans, achieving an impressive accuracy rate of 92%. Utilized advanced techniques including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image recognition, enhancing model performance for tumor identification. The model was trained on a diverse dataset of MRI images, ensuring robust detection across various tumor types and sizes. By implementing data augmentation techniques, the model was able to generalize well, reducing overfitting and improving diagnostic reliability.
This project contributed significantly to the early detection of brain tumors, offering potential for more timely interventions and better patient outcomes. Additionally, the solution included a user-friendly interface to simplify the process for healthcare professionals, enabling them to quickly classify and evaluate brain tumor images. The modelâ€™s performance was benchmarked against several other classification methods, showcasing superior results in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score.
